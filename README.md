# Yens Onboarding, September 2025

Welcome to the Yens Onboarding repository, a hands-on introduction to Stanford GSB's high-performance computing cluster: the Yens. This course is designed for PhD students, postdocs, and new faculty who want to learn how to use the Yens effectively for research computing. Across a series of guided exercises, you'll learn how to navigate the command line, work with JupyterHub, create and manage Python environments, run jobs on the cluster via Slurm, and scale your workloads with best practices for reproducibility and efficiency.
