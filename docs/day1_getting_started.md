## Overview

This first session introduces you to Stanford GSB‚Äôs research computing cluster ‚Äî the Yens. You‚Äôll learn how to log in, navigate the file system, set up reproducible Python environments, and run code interactively on the cluster or through JupyterHub.

## Learning Goals

By the end of today you will be able to:

- Connect to the Yens via SSH and JupyterHub.
- Navigate the file system using basic shell commands.
- Create and activate Python virtual environments.
- Run code via Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks on the Yens.
- Use environment variables securely (e.g., for API keys).
- Install and link Jupyter kernels to your custom environment.

## Part 1: Connecting to the Yens
{: .important} If you are a Mac or Linux user, you can use the native terminal for these exercises.

{: .important} If you are a Windows user, you can use Git Bash to run these commands.


To SSH from your terminal (replace `<SUNetID>`):

```bash
ssh <SUNetID>@yen.stanford.edu
```
You‚Äôll be prompted for Duo authentication.


### Command Line Basics

Explore your environment

```
pwd                   # Show your current directory
ls -lah               # List files, including hidden ones
cd /scratch/shared    # Change directories
cd                    # Go back to your home directory
mkdir new_dir         # Make a new folder
touch test.py         # Create a blank file
rm test.py            # Be careful! This deletes the file
```

Try uploading a file from your laptop to the cluster using scp (run from your local terminal):

```
scp path/to/file.txt <SUNetID>@yen.stanford.edu:~
```
You‚Äôll be prompted for Duo authentication.

## Part 2: Web-based Computing 
To access JupyterHub, choose any of the following:

- <a href="https://yen1.stanford.edu" target="_blank">`yen1` https://yen1.stanford.edu</a>
- <a href="https://yen2.stanford.edu" target="_blank">`yen2` https://yen2.stanford.edu</a>
- <a href="https://yen3.stanford.edu" target="_blank">`yen3` https://yen3.stanford.edu</a>
- <a href="https://yen4.stanford.edu" target="_blank">`yen4` https://yen4.stanford.edu</a>
- <a href="https://yen5.stanford.edu" target="_blank">`yen5` https://yen5.stanford.edu</a>

## Part 3: Create a Python Virtual Environment
  1. Connect to the Yens either via a terminal in JupyterHub or via SSH.

  2. Clone the repo and change directories into it on the Yens:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gsbdarc/yens-onboarding-2025.git
    cd yens-onboarding-2025/exercises
    ``` 

  -‚ùì What is requirements.txt file?

  -‚ùì Why is it useful?

### Exercise 1: Create and activate a virtual environment
Let‚Äôs make a virtual environment from requirements.txt:
```
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Exercise 2: Run python script
Let‚Äôs look at the script called `extract_form_3_one_file.py` inside the `scripts` directory.

-‚ùì: What is the script doing?

- Run it using the virtual env you just made

- ‚ùì: What do you see?
