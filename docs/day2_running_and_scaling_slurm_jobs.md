# {{ page.title }}

## Overview

Today we move from interactive work on the Yens and Jupyter to **running scheduled jobs on the Yens cluster** using Slurm ‚Äî cluster's job scheduler. You‚Äôll learn how to submit jobs, monitor them, debug them, and scale them up for real research.

---

## Learning Goals

By the end of today you will be able to:

- Write and submit Slurm batch job scripts
- Estimate appropriate resources (CPU, memory, time)
- Monitor and cancel running jobs
- Handle failed or stuck jobs
- Organize code for cluster-based research workflows
- Scale up tasks using job arrays


## Cluster Resources

## üíª Run a mystery python script

Login to the Yens. Take a note of which interactive yen (yen[1-5]) you are on. Then, open a new terminal (or second tab if using Jupyter), and connect to the **same** yen. 

Now you should have two terminal both conneted to the same interactive yen. 

In one of the terminals, run my mystery script:

```
cd yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/scripts
python3 mystery_script.py
```

1. While the script is running, in a second terminal connected to the same yen, watch the script run while running `htop`.

2. While the script is running, in a second terminal connected to the same yen, watch the script run while running `htop -u $USER`.

3. While the script is running, in a second terminal connected to the same yen, watch the script run while running `watch userload`.

4. To time the script, run in one of the terminals:

```
time python3 mystery_script.py
```
Key things to watch:

- Peak RAM usage
- Number of cores used
- Runtime


Compare with your neighbor the time, cores and RAM usage for this script.

‚ùì What do you see?

Now we know how many resources the script needs, we can submit it as a batch job to the scheduler requesting the resources from it.

## Submitting your first Yen-Slurm job

Navigate to `~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm` directory:

```
cd ~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm
```

Let‚Äôs make your first slurm job script. You can do this in JupyterHub usign Text Editor.

  1. Make a new file in the `slurm` directory called `my_first_job.slurm`.

  2. Start the file with the bash shebang line:

   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

  3. Add Slurm job configuration flags that request appropriate resources (replace `your_email` with your Stanford email):  

   ```
   #SBATCH --job-name=my-first-job
   #SBATCH --output=my-first-job.out
   #SBATCH --time=10:00
   #SBATCH --mem=4G
   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
   #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
   #SBATCH --mail-user=your_email@stanford.edu
   ```

  The `--output=my-first-job.out` flag tells Slurm to save all job output (printed to screen) in a file named `my-first-job.out` in the same directory (`~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm`).

  4. Finally, add a line to print a message: 

  ```
  echo "Hello there!" 
  ```

  Save this file.

  üü©/üü•

### üíª Let‚Äôs submit it:

Run:
```
sbatch my_first_job.slurm
```
You‚Äôll see output like:

```
Submitted batch job 123456
```

The `123456` is a job ID which is unique for every cluster job. 

## Monitoring slurm jobs

View the job queue:

```
squeue 
```

Or filter to just your jobs:
```
squeue -u $USER
```

Cancel a job if needed:
```
scancel <job-id>
```

## Checking results
After the job completes:

Look at the `.out` file created:
```
cat my-first-job.out
```

You should see:

```
Hello there!
```

If you included your email in `--mail-user`, you‚Äôll also receive an email from Slurm when the job starts and ends.

## Running a python script via slurm
Let‚Äôs now run a real script using Slurm ‚Äî and discuss **paths**, **resource requests**, and how to organize logs.

---

### üìÅ Step 1: Understand paths on the cluster

**Slurm job working directory behavior**:

A Slurm job runs in the **current working directory**, meaning the directory you were in when you ran `sbatch`.

This affects:

- Where the job output files (like `--output=...`) will be written unless an absolute path is given

- Any relative paths used in your Slurm script (e.g., `python scripts/myscript.py`)


So for example:
```
cd ~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm
sbatch my_first_job.slurm
```
This job will:

- Run from the `~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm` folder

- Save output to `~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm/my-first-job.out (because of `--output=my-first-job.out`) 



Now consider this alternative way to run the same job:
```
cd ~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/
sbatch slurm/my_first_job.slurm
```

You‚Äôre submitting the same script, but from a different directory.

This time, the `.out` file will be written to `~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/my-first-job.out`.

Slurm always evaluates relative paths (for logs, scripts, etc.) from the directory where `sbatch` was executed ‚Äî *not* where the `.slurm` file lives.


### Example: calling a python script from `scripts/`
If your slurm job script includes:

```
python scripts/mystery_script.py
```

That line will only work if the current working directory contains the `scripts/` folder.

- If you ran `sbatch` from `~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/`, it works.

- If you ran it from `slurm/`, it will fail unless you `cd ..` or change paths.

### üìù Step 2: Create a slurm script to run `mystery_script.py`
Let‚Äôs write a new Slurm job script that runs the Python script `scripts/mystery_script.py`.

As we know, this script uses multiple CPU cores, so we‚Äôll request **10 cores**.

---

  1. Navigate to the `slurm/` directory:
  
  ```bash
  cd ~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm
  ```

  2. Create a new text file in JupyterHub Text Editor (make sure it's in the `slurm` directory) and paste the following (update the email line!):

  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  #SBATCH --job-name=mystery
  #SBATCH --output=logs/mystery-%j.out
  #SBATCH --time=00:05:00
  #SBATCH --mem=8G
  #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10
  #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
  #SBATCH --mail-user=your_email@stanford.edu
  
  # Move into the correct working directory
  cd ~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises
  
  # Activate your Python environment
  source venv/bin/activate
  
  # Run the Python script
  python scripts/mystery_script.py
  ```
  
  3. Name the file `mystery_script.slurm`.

  #### About the `logs/` Folder
  The line `#SBATCH --output=logs/mystery-%j.out` tells Slurm to write all job output (stdout and stderr) to a file inside the `logs/` folder. The `%j` gets replaced by the Slurm job ID, so each job has its own unique log file.

  Before submitting the job, we must create the `logs` directory:

  ```
  cd ~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm
  mkdir logs
  ```

  We also do the following in the slurm script:

  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

  This activates your python virtual environment. It makes sure you are running the python script using the virtual environment we created earlier.

  ```
  python scripts/mystery_script.py
  ```
  This runs the actual Python script. It assumes you're inside the `exercises/` directory and that the `scripts/` subfolder is there.

  > If you don't `cd` into the correct working directory, relative paths like `scripts/mystery_script.py` may fail.

üü© / üü•

### Step 3: Submit the job to run `mystery_script.py`

We‚Äôre now ready to submit a real python job to the Yen-Slurm cluster.

#### Before submission:
- You created `run_mystery_script.slurm` inside the `slurm/` folder
- You created a `logs/` folder to capture output

Make sure you're in the `slurm/` folder before submitting so that relative paths in the script work correctly:

```bash
cd ~/yens-onboarding-2025/exercises/slurm
sbatch mystery_script.slurm
```

### Step 4: Monitor the Job
To check the status of your job:

```
squeue -u $USER
```

You‚Äôll see a table with columns like JOBID, NAME, STATE, TIME, and NODELIST.
Your job may show up as `PD` (pending), `R` (running), or disappear when it‚Äôs finished.

### Step 5: View the Output Log
Once the job finishes, go to your `logs/` folder and inspect the output:

```
cd logs
ls
```

You should see a file like:
```
mystery-456789.out
```

View it with:

```
cat mystery-456789.out
```

This file contains:

- Any printed output from the script

- Any errors or traceback messages

- Useful debug information

> This is your first file to check when things don‚Äôt work ‚Äî start with the `.out` file.
