## Tips Before Asking for Help

When you run into issues:

1. **Try debugging yourself first**  
   - Read error messages carefully  
   - Check your Slurm log files (`.out`)  
   - Use AI assistants or ask a buddy  

2. **When you reach out, share three things:**  
   - What you tried (commands or script you ran)  
   - What you expected to happen  
   - What actually happened (error messages or output)  

This context helps us resolve your issue quickly and helps you learn more effectively.
